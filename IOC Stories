TITLE: UNCOVERING SUSPECTED US POLITICAL CAMPAIGN

STORY:
An Austrian IP with clean track record found collecting Sensitive US Data including US Voters List (Ohio, Florida & Georgia), Verifications Breach, Numident Records, Consumer Data Dictionary, SSA (Social Security Administration), Invalid SSN Sequence etc.
A dedicated folder titled BF is found, which is short for Breach Forums, which can be assumed as the primary source of Data Collection for this 
The group collects breaches related to the US Government from Ransomware Group like Rhysida who had compromised Columbus.Gov and Sumter County Sheriff (both are present).
Some of the citizens' records date back to the early 20th Century such as in 1909!
Hence, it can be assumed that this is a staging server for the preparation of any Fraudulent Political Campaigns maintained by any group in advance of US Elections.
Additionally, the group also collects data on luxurious brands such as Luxottica (Premium Eyewear), DeltaDental, Acuity (Insurance Provider), WatchMax (UK’s Diamond Jewellary) etc in a folder named “ZZ.TG.Downloads”.

TITLE: FOUND A KOREAN 🇰🇷 IP HOSTING UEFI BOOTKITTY BOOTKIT TARGETING LINUX

STORY: An IP address hosting all 3 malwares - Rootkit Agents BCDropper and BCObserver and Bootkitty were found.While analyzing BCDropper (d734c6a86fab0c66a899d3412347bc99) found few code match with Snapekit, which is a sophisticated rootkit targeting Arch Linux (6.10.2-arch1-1 x86_64). It hooks 21 syscalls, hides its payload, and evades detection by dropping in user space while dodging analysis tools & debuggers, uncovered by Gen ThreatLabs in October 2024. Bootkitty (43e0656340c4c6ccf7f22f3ddc75ded2) has a network communication established with 188.114.97.7, a Cloudflare IP which is commonly used for malicious communications. The other 2 samples does not have any code-overlap with any other existing malware (as of now).
